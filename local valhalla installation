Hello,
currently I am trying to have the valhalla route calculation engine installed locally either under docker under windows or under docker under virtualbox using ubuntu commands.
my question and that I tried a lot of codes but I haven't managed to install it yet,
I would like you to help me by sending me a code which you have already tried and with success.
awaiting a favorable response, please receive my best greetings.
